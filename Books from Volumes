#MAKE Books FROM VOLUMES

#make Chapters from Books

# split volume into books based on the 1st word inserted designator: 
awk '/designator/{line="book"++i;}{print > line;}' volumefile 

# rename a bookfile with the name of the first line: 
awk 'FNR==1 {file=$0} {print > (file".txt")}' bookfiles*

# delete the designator from all .txt files:
sed -i 's/designator//' *.txt

#Repeat the process for chapters from books.
